# !['Logo - FocalPoint'](/src/assets/Logomark.png)  Junior Dev Challenge - TodoList - Legaplan !['Logo - FocalPoint'](/src/assets/Logomark.png)

## üìå About the Challenge:

### This project is a challenge proposed by the LegaPlan team for a Junior Developer position. The key points are:
- The project must be built using NextJS with App Router and SCSS
- Beyond good coding practices, maximum design fidelity is expected. Pay attention to details such as shadows, gradients, and more.

## üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ How to navigate the project?

### All source code files are located in: `./src`

## üõà Project structure

- `./src/app:` This project uses App Router, but there are no additional routes. Here you‚Äôll find the index page and the layout with global config and the favicon.

- `./src/assets:` All project images are stored here.

- `./src/components:` Reusable components used throughout the project. In this first version, we have:
    - Button: Buttons
    - Header
    - LocalStorage: Renders all stored tasks
    - Modal: Both modals
    - Tasks: Wraps and renders everything on the Page

- `./src/contexts:` Shared application-wide data. In this version, it includes Modal contexts (folder: Modals).
    - Note: The `AppProvider.tsx` file groups all providers and exports them as one.

- `./src/hooks:` Custom hooks containing the app‚Äôs logic.

- `./src/services:` Contains service functionalities. In this version, only one file `QueryClient.ts` is used to create and export the QueryClient provider directly (using 'use client').

- `./src/styles:` Contains styling files. In this version, a single file `GlobalStyles.scss` contains global styles.

## ‚ùî How to run the project on your machine?

- Although the live link is at the top, feel free to run the code locally! Here's how:

- First, you need Git installed on your computer.
    - Windows: Download Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the installation steps.
    - macOS: Download <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac" target="_blank">here</a> or use Homebrew:
        ```bash
        brew install git
        ```
    - Linux: Use your distro‚Äôs package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu):
        ```bash
        sudo apt install git
        ```

- Open the terminal (Git Bash on Windows is fine)

- Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project

- Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GuilhermeFranciscoPereira/CaseJR-TodoList-Legaplan.git
    ```

- Enter the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd CaseJR-TodoList-Legaplan
    ```

- Open the project in your preferred editor. Example with VSCode:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

- üö® Important! To avoid code errors after cloning, run:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

- To run the project locally:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
